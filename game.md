## External vs Internal Motivation

When and how is internal motivation generaed? HealthyGamerGG thinks this generation is harder to come by internal motivation.
If Internal motivation isn't naturally occurring, I hope that external motivation can build the good habits to subconsciously build internal motivation

## Basic premise - Giving structured external motivation for children

Being raised with video games, I find a lot of patterns that have given me motivation within games.  I think those patterns could be used to help give clear, explicit goals and rewards to give motivation to my kids.

### Provide quests as a structure to give goals and rewards for accomplishing something

A quest is generally just a request with an explicit reward attached.  The request should be something directly actionable, that the parent/admin feels is reasonable to provide motivation

These quests can be dailys, weeklys, or ad-hoc. Quests 

### Sample quest list

- Dailys
  - Excercise for an hour
  - Participate in a sport or extracurricular
  - an hour of hobby time
  - Watch some sort of edcuational content, finishing with an explanation of what you learned
- Ad-hoc
  - Do dishes, garbage, lawnwork, laundry
- Team quests (need to do with a parent)
  - Washing a car
  - Getting groceries
  - Therapy time (chatting with the parent for an hour about something that's bothering you, or that you need help with)

### Rewards
- Have a weekly target of X quests completed. Have an allowance based off this target.
- Perhaps some points system that can be redeemed for either cash or favors, like late bed times or more entertainment time.

## Metagaming

The goal is to formalize what we (as parents) believe is a reasonable balance between development, entertainment, rewards, contribution to the household, etc.

- Kids should be encouraged to find the best ways to optimize/"cheat" the system.
  - Should be easy to find hobbies you enjoy, and get a "Free" daily quest completed
  - Find ways to reasonably double-up on tasks
- Quests don't necessarily have to be directly results-oriented.  "Therapy time" is more of an encouragement to open up and share with your parents, rather than getting a specific thing done.
- There is "Game balance" that should always be considered - ensuring there's a fair opportunity for the kids to reach their goal while still providing enough motivation to follow through with completing quests
