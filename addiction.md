# Addiction

Social media, games are all designed to feed on your attention and endorphins

## Addiction to chance/gambling

 gatchas and loot boxes

## Addiction to acknowledgement

Social media feeds the brain's need to feel accepted 

I want kids to appreciate my validation, but not be beholden to it

## Addiction to positive feedback/endless game loops

Feel-good vapid gameplay loops vs actualize improvement in some skill

Observe growth vs just grinding
