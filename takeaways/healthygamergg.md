## Communication in Relationships, understanding what your needs are around relationships 

- [Why it's your fault you got Ghosted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvpDLpCf1jU)
  - You can have needs or anxieties, but you need to come to terms with those and express the root issues to your SO if you expect them to help resolve them
  - Being clingy in a relationship is rooted in some sort of anxiety that needs to be understood and addressed head on instead of trying to resolve it with subtle tactics (like sending long emotionally charged text messages with the expectation of a long thought out message in return to solve every problem you have)
